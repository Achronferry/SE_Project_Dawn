4.5     Limitation

This software can’t run low-performance hardware equipment, because our system is a large web-based system. Actually, the hardware is cheaper and cheaper recently. This is not a big problem any longer.

Our game can only run in Android device, which is a foundamental limitation 




4.6	Technique Capability

The J2EE technique is good at developing the systems like BTS. And we choose it as our main technique when develop BTS. So we can say, if we master J2EE, it is easy to achieve our goals.

We have five peoples in our team. Everyone is a veteran in oo-program field and can study new technique quickly. We all have J2SE to developing experience before. This may help a lot. 

Our team has a good professional consultant who comes from SJTU. He will supervise us during the whole project life cycle.

Five people are enough to develop such a system, and we are sure we can finish it ahead of the deadline. See details in the project plan documents.
