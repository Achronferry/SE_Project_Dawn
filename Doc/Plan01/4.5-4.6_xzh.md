4.5     Limitation

This software can’t run low-performance hardware equipment, because our system is a large web-based system. Actually, the hardware is cheaper and cheaper recently. This is not a big problem any longer.

Our game can only run in Android device, which is a fundamental limitation.




4.6	Technique Capability

Generally, our game is not quite so simple to implement considering that we are not so familiar with JAVA development, and now I will go deeper analyze the feasibility in technique: 

a)       With current technology, the communication part is easy to achieve, we intend to use TCP/IP or UDP to implement the communication model. Besides, the JAVA has various modules for us to write a complete game, so it is not a problem as long as we study the JAVA well.

b)       With the limitation mentioned above, there is nothing in particular that will inhibit us from developing the whole project.

c)       We have five peoples in our team, and we are all experienced in software developing. Besides we have a talented professor who will supervise us during the whole project life cycle. Five people are enough to develop such a system, and we are sure we can finish it ahead of the deadline. See details in the project plan documents. 

d)       The expected project life cycle is the whole semester, and additionally with the professor’s help, we all believe that this will not be a hard rock to crack.
