4.1 Introduction to Our Game

Our game is based on client-server architecture. With our server collecting real-time data from player's devices, it also does the job of computation. 

The brief physical architecture view can be showed as follow:

a) Client-server architecture is applied in our game system. Most of the multiplayer games available online are based on a client-server architecture because this architecture gives better administration control to the game providers. This architecture prevents players from cheating as all the game logic is executed on the centralized server. However, because of the varying and high latency of wireless networks and of the changing consistency requirements during the game play, it is difficult to keep the user experience highly interactive in client-server architecture. The server applies consistency mechanism on its side, as in the traditional client-server architecture and dynamically switches to apply a client side consistency mechanism when inconsistencies occur at the client side because of the change in network conditions and/or game requirements.

b) Client side will include sending and receiving data simultaneously. When player executes an order, like clicking a control button, the executing order will be sent to the server through internet protocol. When the server receives data, it starts computing with game logic, and sends the state data to all the players synchronously. This is a classic loop of game process, where all the game logic is decided by a specific server.

c) Server side will include receiving data and making judgements by game logic. We would like to build up a control panel for the server side, so that all the competition can be visible through this control panel. Meantime there are several problems to interfere with.

Synchronization Problem: A serious problem we will be facing would be the synchronization problem. We will have to figure out what to do when a communication delay occurs, or even worse, when a connection is totally lost (due to internet breakdown or quitting of game).

Game Logic: Our team will  have to figure out a set of game logic to make the game playable and leverage the computing pressure at the same time. This kind of game logic would require careful design. Besides, we need a logic tool to prevent players from cheating.
