4.4	Impact

4.4.1	Impacts to the Device

The server used to run the game system must require:

CPU: PentiumIV 1.3Ghz or better

Main memory: 512MB or more



Minimum requirements for DAWN is as follows:

OS: Android™4.3 or higher verison
 Memory: 2 GB RAM
 Network: Wifi or 4G connection


 Recommended requirements for DAWN is as follows:

OS: Android™4.3 or higher verison
 Memory: 4 GB RAM
 Network: Wifi or 4G connection





4.4.2	Impacts to the Software

The game server need to be run under the JAVA environment, so Linux or Windows will satisfy our requirements.

The Dawn Game need to be run on Android™4.3 or higher version. Our future plan is to transplant the game to ios devices.



4.4.3	Impacts to the User 

Any android user will have access to the game. Windows users are allowed to use virtual environment to enjoy the same game.

A server administrator is needed to maintain the normal operation of game server.



4.4.4	Impacts to the Run-time Process

In this section I will talk about the influence on the Run-time Process.

a)       The user can play this game in almost any generation of Android devices, or he can play it in a virtual machine based on Windows/Linus/MacOS;

b)       The game is supposed to be friendly-to-user, anyone can learn to paly this game in a relative short time;

c)       The gaming data will be stored in our central server, and we will thus be able to repeat the specific game and identify the possible cheater.

d)       When the user triggers a bug, there should be a way to stop the procedure and at least spare the system from dying.

e)       When a connection is lost, users should be able to reconnect to the server and continue the game.



4.4.5   Impacts to the Development

We need to know how a bug is fixed, tracked, and managed. 

We also need to know which data of a bug is necessary in its bug life cycle.

The common software developers and testers can describe them. Ourselves are software developers.

In order to develop and test, we need at least seven computers: one to run DBMS and store the data, the rest can be used for our developing, and act as clients when we test the whole system.

Luckily, our system is product-oriented; all the knowledge we need to know is common and open to every software developers. And there is no security problem exists.
